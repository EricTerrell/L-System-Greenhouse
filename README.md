# L-Systems

L-Systems (Lindenmayer Systems) are scripts written in a simple *formal grammar*, consisting of a starting string,
called an *axiom*, and rewrite rules, called *productions*.

The axiom is converted into output by using the productions to convert letters in the axiom. Then the output can be
converted, for a specified number of iterations. The final output can be displayed graphically by converting it into
"turtle graphics" commands:

Remarkably, these simple grammars can generate graphics of spectacular beauty.
